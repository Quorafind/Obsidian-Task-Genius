## Key Features

-   **Task Progress Bars**: Visualize parent task completion with customizable graphical or text-based progress bars based on sub-task status. Supports headings and non-task list items.
-   **Advanced Task Statuses & Cycling**: Define custom task statuses beyond `- [ ]` and `- [x]` (e.g., In Progress `[/]`, Planned `[?]`, Abandoned `[-]`). Easily cycle through statuses with clicks or commands.
-   **Date & Priority Management**: Quickly add and modify due dates via a calendar picker (`📅 2023-12-25`) and assign priorities (🔺 Highest, ⏫ High, ..., [#A], [#B], [#C]) through context menus, commands, or clickable icons.
-   **In-Editor Task Filtering**: Dynamically filter tasks within a note based on status, content, tags, and relationships (parent/child/sibling) using a toggleable panel. Save and reuse common filters as presets.
-   **Task Mover**: Archive completed or specific sets of sub-tasks to a designated file using commands, keeping your active notes clean.
-   **Quick Capture**: Rapidly capture tasks or notes to a specified file via an inline panel (`Alt+C`), a global command, or a full-featured modal for adding metadata.
-   **Workflow Management**: Define multi-stage workflows (e.g., Todo -> Doing -> Review -> Done) and track tasks through them. Includes options for automatic timestamping, duration tracking, and next-task creation.
-   **Dedicated Task View**: A powerful, unified interface (`Task Genius: Open Task Genius view`) to see, sort, filter, and manage all tasks across your vault. Includes modes like Inbox, Forecast, Tags, Projects, and Review.
-   **Customizable Settings**: Extensive options to configure the appearance and behavior of all features.
