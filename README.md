## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task Progress Bars** | Visualize parent task completion with customizable graphical or text-based progress bars based on sub-task status. Supports headings and non-task list items. |
| **Advanced Task Statuses & Cycling** | Define custom task statuses beyond `- [ ]` and `- [x]` (e.g., In Progress `[/]`, Planned `[?]`, Abandoned `[-]`). Easily cycle through statuses with clicks or commands. |
| **Date & Priority Management** | Quickly add and modify due dates via a calendar picker (`📅 2023-12-25`) and assign priorities (🔺 Highest, ⏫ High, ..., [#A], [#B], [#C]) through context menus, commands, or clickable icons. |
| **In-Editor Task Filtering** | Dynamically filter tasks within a note based on status, content, tags, and relationships (parent/child/sibling) using a toggleable panel. Save and reuse common filters as presets. |
| **Task Mover** | Archive completed or specific sets of sub-tasks to a designated file using commands, keeping your active notes clean. |
| **Quick Capture** | Rapidly capture tasks or notes to a specified file via an inline panel (`Alt+C`), a global command, or a full-featured modal for adding metadata. |
| **Workflow Management** | Define multi-stage workflows (e.g., Todo -> Doing -> Review -> Done) and track tasks through them. Includes options for automatic timestamping, duration tracking, and next-task creation. |
| **Dedicated Task View** | A powerful, unified interface (`Task Genius: Open Task Genius view`) to see, sort, filter, and manage all tasks across your vault. Includes modes like Inbox, Forecast, Tags, Projects, and Review. |
| **Customizable Settings** | Extensive options to configure the appearance and behavior of all features. |
| **Rewards** | Earn rewards for completing tasks. |
| **Habit Tracking** | Track your habits with a dedicated view. |
