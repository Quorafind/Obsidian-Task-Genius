## Workflow Feature

Task Genius includes a powerful workflow feature that allows you to track tasks through different stages of completion. This feature helps with project management and tracking task progression.

### How to Use Workflows

1. **Enable Workflows**: First enable the workflow feature in settings.

2. **Basic Workflow Syntax**:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] My task #workflow/project_workflow/planning
   ```

   This creates a task in the "Planning" stage of the "Project Workflow".

3. **Workflow Progression**:
   - When you complete a task by checking it, the workflow automatically advances to the next stage
   - The workflow tag updates (e.g., from `#workflow/project_workflow/planning` to `#workflow/project_workflow/in_progress/development`)
   - A timestamp of the completion is added when configured

4. **Cycle Stages with Sub-stages**:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] My task #workflow/project_workflow/in_progress/development
   ```

   This task is in the "Development" sub-stage of the "In Progress" stage.

### Default Workflow Structure

The default "Project Workflow" includes these stages:

1. **Planning** (linear stage)
   - Next stage: In Progress

2. **In Progress** (cycle stage with sub-stages)
   - Sub-stages: Development, Testing
   - Can proceed to: Review, Cancelled

3. **Review** (cycle stage)
   - Can proceed to: In Progress, Completed

4. **Completed** (terminal stage)

5. **Cancelled** (terminal stage)

### Workflow Context Menu

Right-click on any task to:
- Add a workflow to a task
- Change the current workflow stage
- Add child tasks with the same workflow stage

### Workflow Settings

- **Enable Workflow**: Turn the workflow feature on/off
- **Auto Add Timestamp**: Automatically add a timestamp when a task moves to a new stage (enabled by default)
- **Auto Add Next Task**: Automatically create a new task for the next stage (disabled by default)
