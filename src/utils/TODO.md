# Refactoring TODO List

## Task Index Refactoring

### High Priority Tasks
- [ ] Remove non-task related indexing from importer.ts
- [ ] Optimize task data indexing for high performance
- [ ] Refactor worker implementation to focus only on task-related data
- [ ] Implement incremental updates for task data
- [ ] Redesign data structures for task metadata based on task-view.md

### Data Structure Optimization
- [ ] Simplify task cache structure to include only task-relevant fields
- [ ] Design efficient indexing for task filtering and querying
- [ ] Implement optimized data structures for tag and date indexing
- [ ] Reduce memory footprint of task index

### Worker Optimization
- [ ] Refactor web worker implementation for better performance
- [ ] Implement batch processing of task updates
- [ ] Add support for priority-based task processing
- [ ] Improve throttling mechanism for background processing

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Design a metadata import strategy compatible with task-view.md
- [ ] Implement LRU cache for frequently accessed tasks
- [ ] Add support for efficient task dependency tracking
- [ ] Create API for external plugin integration

## Architecture Improvements
- [ ] Separate task parsing from task indexing logic
- [ ] Create dedicated service for task data management
- [ ] Implement event-based system for task updates
- [ ] Add telemetry for performance monitoring (opt-in)

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Fix type errors in current implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for task indexing
- [ ] Document all public APIs and interfaces
- [ ] Create migration path for future index structure changes
