# Claude Instructions for This Repository

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT CREATE PULL REQUESTS TO UPSTREAM

This is a personal fork (`chrisweis/Obsidian-Task-Genius-CJW`) of `Quorafind/Obsidian-Task-Genius`.

**All changes should be committed directly to this fork's master branch.**

### Rules

1. **NEVER** create pull requests to `Quorafind/Obsidian-Task-Genius`
2. **NEVER** use `gh pr create` without explicit user confirmation
3. When user asks to "create a PR", ask: "This is your personal fork - do you need a PR, or should I just commit to master?"

### Correct Workflow

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Commit directly to your fork
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master

# ❌ WRONG: Do not create PRs to upstream
gh pr create  # This defaults to upstream - DON'T USE
```
