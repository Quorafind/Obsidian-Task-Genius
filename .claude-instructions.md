# Claude Instructions for This Repository

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT CREATE PULL REQUESTS TO UPSTREAM

**THIS IS A PERSONAL FORK - DO NOT CREATE PRS TO THE UPSTREAM REPOSITORY**

This repository (`chrisweis/Obsidian-Task-Genius-CJW`) is a personal fork of `Quorafind/Obsidian-Task-Genius`.

### Repository Workflow Rules

1. **NEVER create pull requests to `Quorafind/Obsidian-Task-Genius`**
2. **NEVER use `gh pr create` without explicitly specifying `--repo chrisweis/Obsidian-Task-Genius-CJW`**
3. All changes should be committed directly to this fork's master branch
4. This is a personal development repository, not for upstream contributions

### If User Asks to "Create a PR"

When the user asks to create a PR, ask for clarification:
- "Do you want to create a PR within your fork, or just commit to master?"
- "This is your personal fork - do you need a PR, or should I just commit the changes?"

### Correct Workflow

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Commit to your fork
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master

# ❌ WRONG: Do not create PRs to upstream
gh pr create  # This defaults to upstream repo - DON'T DO THIS

# ✅ ONLY IF EXPLICITLY REQUESTED: Create PR within the fork
gh pr create --repo chrisweis/Obsidian-Task-Genius-CJW --base master --head feature-branch
```
